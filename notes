- About organizing the folders in a React project, I chose the popular pattern, the "feature-based" or "module-based" folder structure, where each module or feature of your application has its own folder containing all of the related files. In this structure, the components folder contains reusable UI components that are used across multiple pages. The pages folder contains the main views of your app, each with their own subfolder for any components or assets specific to that page. The services folder contains any code that interacts with external APIs or backend services. The utils folder contains any shared utilities or constants.
